## App 1 - The Website you are Exploring Now
![](/images/working-fast.png)

### Description
  This is a Hugo-based web application. Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again. Hugo is an integral component of the JAMstack architecture.  
  JAMstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It is a modern web development architecture and methodology that shifts away from the traditional server-side rendering approach to building websites.

### Technologies
- **Hugo**
  - A fast and flexible static site generator, powering the dynamic content rendering of my portfolio.
- **Github Actions**
  - GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that enables developers to create custom workflows to build, test, and deploy their code directly from GitHub repositories.
- **CI/CD** 
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a development practice that automates code integration and deployment processes, allowing for faster and more reliable software delivery.
- **YAML**
  - YAML is used in Hugo for configuration purposes, providing a human-readable format to define various settings, menus, and parameters for the website, making it easy to manage and customize the Hugo site.

## App 2 - Coming Up ...

I have created a ton of apps but I deleted most of them as I want to have fewer apps of better quality instead.  So I will add them as I make them.
